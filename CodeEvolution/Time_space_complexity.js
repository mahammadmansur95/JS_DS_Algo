//The performance of an algorithm is evaluated in terms of its input size.

//Time complexity -> Amount of time taken by an algoritm to run, as a function of input size.
//Space complexity -> Amount of memory taken by an algorith to run, as a function of input size.

/* Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity */
// 1 -> Big-O Notation => Worst case complexity
// 2 -> Omega Notation => Best case complexity
// 3 -> Theta Notation => Average case complexity
